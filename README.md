# eye-tracker

A small Python project where two cartoon eyes follow your mouse around the screen.
What I used
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Python extension in VS Code
- Pygame installed in a terminal:
       -pip install pygame


How I ran it
- Opened VS Code
- Created a file called eyetracker.py
- Wrote the Python code
- Opened the terminal in VS Code
- Ran the code 

This opened a window where the eyes followed my mouse.
What it does
- Draws two eyes on the screen
- The pupils move and follow the mouse
- Keeps the pupils inside the eyeballs using some basic math
